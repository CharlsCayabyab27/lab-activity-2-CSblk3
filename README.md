## Introduction

In this Jupyter Notebook, we will calculate and display word frequencies from a given text using Python. The notebook includes Python code for text processing and a Markdown section to display the word frequencies.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed on your system.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`word_frequencies.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook.

4. Execute the code cells to calculate word frequencies and view the results in the Markdown section.

## Word Frequencies

In the Jupyter Notebook, we use Python to tokenize a text and calculate word frequencies. The resulting word frequencies are displayed in a table using Markdown. Here's a sample table with word-frequency pairs:

| Word      | Frequency |
|-----------|-----------|
| example   | 10        |
| text      | 8         |
| analysis  | 5         |
| ...

You can customize the notebook to work with your own text data.
